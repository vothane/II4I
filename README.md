Test bed for experimenting for Deep Learning integration onto Dronecode Python SDK with functionality 
such as object detection and autonomous flight. The actual code and such is in a private repo **iSky**.

Experiments with things such as CapsNet and One-Shot YOLO for object detection, plus more.
As for autonomous flight, reinforcement learning & etc., is too large and complex to be included
in this notebook.
